# gaussian-prime-sieve

This is an implementation of sieve of Eratosthenes to generate primes in the Gaussian integers.  The Gaussian integers are complex numbers of the form a+bi for integers a and b, and enjoy many of the same properties of the rational integers.  In particular, Gaussian integers factorize uniquely into primes, and sieving algorithms can be used to compute primes.

The goal of this project is to build an efficient implementation of a prime-generating sieve in the Gaussian integers in both Python and C, and to provide a library for deeper exploration.

## Algorithm

Below is a sketch of this implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes in the Gaussian integers.  Suppose we want to generate Gaussian primes with norm up to x, some large real number.

1. Initialize an empty 2-dimensional array with index (a, b) corresponding to the Gaussian integer a + bi.  In this way, we can simply view this array as a finite subset of the Gaussian integers.  By restricting to the first quadrant of the complex plane, we take a and b to be nonnegative integers with a^2 + b^2 <= x.  Mark off the array at the Gaussian integers 0, 1, and i.  These Gaussian integers are neither prime nor composite.
2. Locate the unmarked Gaussian integer &pi; with smallest norm.  Necessarily &pi; is prime.  Leave the array empty at pi but mark off every Gaussian integer multiple of &pi;.
3. Loop over the process in step 2 by marking off multiples of the other previously unmarked Gaussian primes.  Continue looping until every unmarked entry with norm less than sqrt x has been used for sieving.
4. The unmarked entries that remain in the array are exactly the Gaussian primes.

Compared with the usual sieve of Eratsthenes in the rational integers, step 2 is somewhat more involved in Z[i].  There are several cases to consider depending on the splitting behavior of the prime pi in question.


- If &pi; = a + bi with b = 0, necessarily a = p is prime with p = 3 mod 4.  In this case, &pi; is a rational integer, and we can simply mark off all Gaussian integers of the form (s + ti) p to eliminate multiples of &pi;.  Here, the multiples (s + ti) p for s and t in Z form a lattice perpendicular to the coordinate axes, and so the marking can be easily implemented with nested for-loops.


- If &pi; = a + bi with a and b nonzero, then the norm N(&pi;) = a^2 + b^2 must equal a prime p.  Either p = 2 or p = 1 mod 4, and p is said to ramify or split, respectively.  In either case, p is a prime of degree 1, meaning that the additive quotient group Z[i] / &pi;Z[i] is a group of order p^1.  Furthermore, the element &pi; has order p in the group Z[i] / pZ[i].  To construct multiples of &pi; in Z[i], we will construct elements of additive group generated by &pi;, then translate them by multiplies of p.  Specifically, letting s + ti be one of the p distinct elements in the additive subgroup generated by &pi; mod p, we mark off all Gaussian integers of the form (s + ti) p.  As in the first case, this marking-off can be implemented with nested for-loops.  The elements s + ti can be obtained by reducing the coefficients of k(a+bi) mod p for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., p - 1.

The theorem that makes this procedure succeed can be stated as follows.  With &pi; a degree 1 prime, given any Gaussian integer &alpha;, there exists a Gaussian integer &delta; and a rational integer $d$ such that &pi; &alpha; = d &pi; + &delta; p.  In other words, the Gaussian-integer-multiple of &pi; given by &pi; &alpha; can be obtained through this aforementioned process.

There are several ways to prove this.  One explicit way to do so is to let &pi; = a + bi and &alpha; = u + vi.  Let c in Z be the multiplicative inverse of b modulo p.  Then bc = 1 mod p, and so bc = 1 mod &pi;&#773; since &pi;&#773; divides p.  Because a = bi mod &pi;&#773;, it follows that ac = i mod &pi;&#773;.  Therefore
u + vi = u + vac mod &pi;&#773;
which shows that &alpha; = d mod &pi;&#773; for some rational integer d.  Unpacking this congruence, we have
&alpha; - d = &pi;&#773; &delta;
for some &delta; in Z[i].  Multiplying both sides of this equation by &pi; gives the desired conclusion.
